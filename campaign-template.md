# Campaign

## Concept

A small party of adventurers must find an important item in Havronan's Tomb.
Dungeon crawl using Mythic Magazine 3's dungeon generation procedure.

## Aim

I'll keep going until I reach the goal (item). Be quick!

## Tone

[What is the tone of the game? Are there different options for gameplay? (Serious vs. Gonzo, Action vs. Drama, etc.).]

## Solo Gaming

[What novel factors will this campaign bring in? What procedures will you use for generating content, such as dungeons, or wilderness and city areas? How will you generate interesting scenes and avoid logjams? Ideas:
- Find or create maps
- Find character art
- Write flashbacks
- Add details about the setting
