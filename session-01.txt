## Setup

The heroes are ambushed outside the entrance to Havronan's Tomb.





## Scene 1
Setup: The heroes are ambushed outside the entrance to Havronan's Tomb.  

Few days since the group set off from Malfen. Finally found the entrance to the Tomb. Skerrig provided the map, Malory the map reading skills, and Chania the skills necessary to traverse the wilderness.

Now, outside the tomb, the group has made camp. The doors are huge, at least 20ft tall, and built into the side of the mountain. Neither Malory nor Skerrig can figure out how to open the doors. As the group ponders the mystery, they hear the snap of a branch.

	COMBAT
	Surprise. Roll 1d6 for each PC. Surprised on 1 or 2. I'll say that Chania is only surprised on a 1.
	Chania 1. Surprised.
	Malory 5. OK.
	Skerrig 1. Surprised.

	Initiative
	Party: 5
	Enemy: 5

	What is the enemy? I'll say it's 3 (1d6) dwarf zombies armed with hand axes and picks (1d6).

	Zombie 1 HP: 4
	Zombie 2 HP: 1
	Zombie 3 HP: 4

As Skerrig and Chania ponder the markings on the door, Malory hears the snap of a twig. He looks up to see three figures shamble out of the nearby undergrowth.

> MALORY  
> Err, folks looks like we're in trouble!

### Round 1

	Malory will cast his Magic Shield spell. His AC is now 16.
	Zombie 1 attacks Malory. 2. Miss.
	Zombie 2 attacks Chania. 11. Miss.
	Zombie 3 attacks Skerrig. 15. Hits for 4 damage, reduced by 4.

Three dwarven zombies armed with mining tools launch themselves at the group. Only one of them lands a hit that connected, deflected by Skerrig's armour.

### Round 2

	Malory attacks Zombie 1. 14. Hits for 6 damage, reduced by 1. It's dead.
	Chania attacks Zombie 2. 11. Hits for 3 damage, reduced by 1. It's dead.
	Skerrig attacks Zombie 3. 11. Hits for 11 damage, reduced by 1. It's dead.

Each of the heroes lands a fatal blow on the zombies, and they fall to the ground, dead.

	NOTE: As they all had the same initiative, I should have had the zombies attack. Forgot.

> SKERRIG  
> Shit! Come on, let's get this door open.

	XP: 3 zombies x 30 XP = 90 XP





## Scene 2
Setup: The heroes see if they can open the door.  
Interrupted: [Procrastinate, new ideas] One of the heroes (Malory) has a chance to find a clue.  
What's fun about this scene: Seeing if the group can get the door open.

The group turns back to the door.

	Malory has the highest Intelligence. Can he figure the door out? Roll 1d6.
	On a 1, 2 or 3, he can open it. 2.
	What's the clue that Malory finds? [Procrastinate, ambush]

As the two warriors poke and prod the door, Malory looks down at one of the dead zombies. Around its neck is a silver amulet. He notice the symbol on it matches an impression in the door. Reaches down, takes it from the body, insert into door. Door begins to swing open.





## Scene 3
Setup: The heroes enter the dungeon  

	I'll use the procedure in Random Dungeon Crawl Generation (RDCG) from Mythic Magazine 3 to handle the crawl.

	Havronan's Tomb
	Dungeon type: Ancient
	Size: Small
	Story:
	- The place is associated with a particular group
	- Originally built for evil purposes
	Descriptors:
	- Mossy or fungi
	- Active natural elements, such as flowing lava, underground river, rushing wind, etc

As the door swings open, a blast of cold air erupts from the doorway accompanied by a putrid, moldy smell. Skerrig smiles at the other two.

> SKERRIG  
> Well done, mage. This is it. We ready?

With slightly trembling hands, Malory lights a torch.

	Note that each torch lasts for 1 hour.





## Area 1
Progress Points: 0  
Location: 4. Expected [Unusual]  
Encounter: 4. None  
Objects: 7. Expected [Long]  

The heroes enter a large chamber with what looks like a huge well in the middle. Two ropes hang taut in the middle, and a large winch sits to the side. There are no other exits from the room. Skerrig begins turning the winch. He turns for what seems like an age. Whatever's on the other end of the winch is heavy. Eventually, a circular wooden platform rises into position, connected to the rope in four places. There's a hole in the middle - the two ends of the rope hang through it. The heroes alight and Skerrig begins pulling one of the ropes. The platform begins to move down.

	I'll say that it takes 10 minutes for Skerrig to lower the platform.
	That's 20 minutes (2 turns) elapsed so far.





## Area 2
Progress Points: 1  
Location: 3. Expected [Location: Watery]  
Encounter: 3. None  
Objects: 9. Random [Object: Hidden]  

Eventually, the platform comes to a halt. Skerrig wipes his brow and breathes a sigh of relief.

	Where are they? RDCG says it's a watery environment, and we know there's an
	active natural element, so I'll say this area has an underground stream.
	Is it a large waterway (50%)? 82. No.

The stonemasonry of the shaft blends with the natural cavern. It's bisected by a stream which, over thousands of years, has dug a channel. It shouldn't be too difficult to hop across.

	I'll roll 1d6+Dexterity bonus for each PC. On a 1-2, they fall and hurt
	themselves in the water.
	Chania 2. She takes 1 damage.
	Malory 2. He takes 1 damage.
	Skerrig 6. He's fine.

The rocks around the edge of the stream are slippery, and Chania and Malory both misjudge their jump.

On the far side of the room, an archway frames the mouth of a tunnel.

	I know there's a hidden object here. Do the heroes find it? For each, roll
	1d6. On a 1, they see it. For Skerrig, it'll be 1-4, thanks to his
	Underground Senses.
	Chania 1.
	Malory 4.
	Skerrig 6.

> CHANIA  
> What's this?

She moves to a section of the wall. As she touches it, it bows to the pressure. She grabs and flings back what appears to be a tarp disguised to look like part of the wall.

	What's the object? [Object: Confusing].
	I didn't reward the heroes for the fight with the zombies, so I'll say this
	is the reward. 10 gp per hit die, so that's 30 gp.

Sitting in an alcove is a small figurine made of an unusual black wood. The form is vaguely humanoid, but twisted and contorted into a grotesque shape. Looking at the object, Chania can't seem to focus on its features, as if they deny even the most basic comprehension.

> CHANIA  
> Must be worth something to someone?

She puts it in her pack, and the party proceeds on down the tunnel.

	I'll mark another turn in this room, so that's 3 elapsed turns.





## Area 3
Progress Points: 2  
Location: 3. Expected [Helpful].
Encounter: 10. Random [Cheerful].
Objects: 10. Random [Intriguing].

	What's the helpful location? Ideas: an infirmary, a refectory, a
	dormitory, a shrine to a god of good. I'll say a shrine.

The tunnel leads to a wide chamber. On the far wall in the center is a raised dias, upon which is a statue around 8 feet tall. The statue looks to be a dwarf in armour. It's clenched fist is held above its heart - a sign of the dwarven god Erulaim, although other aspects of the depiction are different from Skerrig's experience. This must be very, very old.

	What is cheerful about the encounter? Ideas: a spirit, a magic mouth, make
	a random table.

	ENCOUNTERS: DUNGEON LEVEL 1 (1d8)
	1. Demon, Imp
	2. Goblin
	3. Kobold
	4. Orc
	5. Rat, Giant
	6. Skeleton
	7. Stirge
	8. Zombie

	Get 5. Giant rat. I'll say there are 6 (1d6) of them. Why are they
	cheerful? Let's re-roll the Encounter Descriptor. Exotic. They're
	undead rats.

As the torchlight fills the room, several figures in the corner turn. Rat the size of a small dog squint in the light, but these are no ordinary rats. Parts of their fur and flesh have fallen away, revealing the bones and entera beneath. What fur remains is thin and straggly, and their eyes are dead. The smell of rot lingers in the room.

	How do they react? Use Basic D&D Monster Reaction Table.
	First, possible attack.

As the heroes enter the room, the animals sniff the air in a parody of life.

> SKERRIG  
> Malory, get behind Chania and I. These look nasty.

	Roll again. This time, they attack.

As the heroes position themselves at the entrance, the undead rats suddenly fling themselves into action, teeth gnawing in anticipation of their next meal.

	COMBAT
	No surprise this time.

	Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat or
	a lynx. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease. A saving

As the last undead rat falls to Chania's blade, the ranger inspects her wounded arm.

> CHANIA  
> I'll need a healer when we get back to town. I'm sorry.

> MALORY  
> Don't worry. We'll get you back safely.

The magician and the warrior exchange baleful looks. Chania tears a rag from her cloak and begins wrapping her arm.

	I'll use the Binding Wounds rule from Hero's Journey rules. Chania regains
	3 (1d6-1) hp. She's back up to 4 hp.
	Malory does the same. He regains 3 hp. He's back up to 3 hp.

Meanwhile, the other two take in the room. The statue of Erulaim looks on in eternal valiance.

> SKERRIG  
> Erulaim is the god of courage. He is the most fearless, most passionate defender of my people. I've never seen him depicted like this, but it's surely him.

> MALORY  
> What do you mean? What's different?

	What is different about the statue? [Dispute, vehicle]

> SKERRIG  
> Well, for one thing, he rides a chariot pulled by two goats. For another...

	[Spy, food]

> SKERRIG  
> For another, he isn't usually eating.

They look down at the plinth in front of the statue upon which a range of marble delicacies gather dust.

> MALORY  
> Are you sure it's him?

> SKERRIG  
> I'm certain. It's just... Maybe people had different stories about him in the old days. They say this tomb has been here over five hundred years, a long time even by our standards.

	Malory and Skerrig spend a turn searching the statue. Do they find
	anything? I'll say they do on a 1-2. 2. Yes.
	What do they find? [Attainment, danger].
	I'll say they find a magic weapon. Rolling on Random Magic Weapons table
	Get 95. War Hammer +3. I think that's too much, so I'll downgrade to
	War Hammer +1.

Malory moves one of the items on the plinth, and a panel slides open. In the niche, there's a war hammer. The magician holds Skerrig back as he reaches greedily for it.

> MALORY  
> One moment, my friend. There could be fell magicks here.

Skerrig spits in disbelief, but hesitates nevertheless. Malory's eyes begin to roll backwards as he incants strange words of magic. At first, he just looks at the hammer, but then his head cocks and he turns to the exit. Moments later, he turns back and his face returns to normal.

> MALORY  
> The hammer is enchanted.

Skerrig immediately reaches for it and starts taking a few swings. He laughs with joy.

> SKERRIG  
> What craftsmanship! Magic? Pah! This is pure dwarven skill - the only magic you need. Still, I prefer a heavier weapon. But, I shan't complain. What a find!

He hooks the hammer on to his belt.

> SKERRIG  
> You, er, OK there? You seem...distracted.

> MALORY  
> I'm fine. Just... there was something else, something out there. I'm not sure what it was. Hopefully just an overactive imagination.

	Time passed: 1 turn. That's 4 turns in total. The torch has 2 turns left.





## Area 4
Progress Points: 3
Location: 4. Expected [Location: New]  
Encounter: 12. None
Objects: 11. Known (blue goo).

	Before we go on, I didn't decide what the heroes are looking for in
	Havronan's Tomb. I'll use The Adventure Crafter to generate a quest.
	New quest: The Blue Goo.

There are two exits here, east and west. The goes west. It's not long before they come to some kind of cave-in. The passage continues west, but it looks like a new branch has opened up. Rocks lies on the ground, and a passage slopes up to the north.

> SKERRIG  
> This looks recent. I'll bet some creature made this. Come on. Let's see where it goes.

> CHANIA  
> Wait. If it's a creature, it must be pretty big. Are you sure we're up to it? A few giant rats nearly had us back there.

> SKERRIG  
> Well, for a start, there were more than "a few". And secondly, they were undead. Makes all the difference. Come on, we can handle it. Besides, our job is to "explore" the tomb. No explore, no payday.

The ranger nods.

> CHANIA  
> After you, payday.

They venture into the branching passage. As they turn a corner, they are face with a remarkable sight. The tunnel ends, but the walls of the cave glow a strange bluish light. Thin veins of neon blue crisscross the cave walls.

> SKERRIG  
> What in Erulaim's forge is this?

	Does Malory know? I'll say he does on a 1 in 1d6. 5. No.

> MALORY  
> No idea. Incredible, though. Looks like a seam of ore. Can you dig some out?

Skerrig takes a few swings with his pick, loosening some stones. He reaches down to pick one up. The ore runs right through it. Malory examines it with his magical awareness.

> MALORY  
> It's certainly magical. I'd have to spend some more time with it to know exactly what it is.

The group turns back to the main corridor.

	Time passed: 1 turn. That's 5 turns in total. The torch has 1 turn left.





## Area 5
Progress Points: 4  
Location: 12. Complete.  
Encounter: 9. Random [Frantic]  
Objects: 7. Expected.

The party moves further down the corridor, and eventually into a large room. Dotted around the room are various urns and reliquaries, and set into the walls are loculi housing long-decomposed bodies. In the centre of the room is a large, ornate sarcophagus. What truly disturbs the heroes, however, is a long, blue crystal protruding from the ground near the sarcophagus, probably 7 or 8 feet tall, and glowing with a pulsating light.

The lid of the sarcophagus begins to slide away as they enter. It clatters to the ground with a resounding boom, and a figure slowly sits upright. It is a dwarf dressed in ancient armour and carrying a large war hammer and shield. Its thin wispy hair and beard creepy from under a helmet. Blood vessels that once might have carried the lifeblood of the creature now glow blue, like the nearby crystal, and its eyes - also glowing blue - fix on the intruders.

> HAVRONAN  
> Who else dares to enter the resting place of Havronan, lord of the mountain? For centuries I lie in peace, but now you surface dwellers come to rob my haven. Face my wrath, trespassers!

The undead thing gets up from its sitting position, jumps down and turns to face the party.

	HAVRONAN (WIGHT)
	Armor Class: 8 [11]
	Reduction Value: 2
	Base Hit Bonus: +3
	Hit Dice: 3
	HP: 8
	Attacks: Claw (See below)
	Special: See below
	Move: 9
	HDE/XP: 5/240
	Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and burial mounds (barrows). They are
	undead, and thus not affected by Sleep or Charm spells. Wights are immune
	to all nonmagical weapons, with the exception of silver weapons. The attack
	of a Wight drains one level per successful attack. Any character who is
	drained of their levels (i.e. reduced to zero level) by such attacks rises
	as a Wight under their creator’s control.

	COMBAT

### Round 1

	Initiative:
	Party 6
	Havronan 4

> SKERRIG  
> [Whispering] Stay behind me, both of you. Your shield.

Chania hands him her shield.

> SKERRIG
> [Aloud] Creature from beyond the grave, we are here to return you to your resting place. Prepare fo your doom!

	Skerrig has AC 14 for this combat.
	Skerrig rushes and attacks the creature. 19 vs AC 11. Hits for 5 points of
	magical damage.
	Chania fires an arrow. 6 vs AC 11. Miss.
	Malory just hangs back.
	Havronan claws at Skerrig. 13 vs AC 14. Miss.

The creature screams in unholy pain as Skerrig strikes it with his magical warhammer. That was a lucky find. The creature tries to claw at him, but he deflects it with his shield.

### Round 2

	Initiative:
	Party 6
	Havronan 5

	Skerrig swings again at the creature. 11 vs AC 11. Hits for 7 magical
	damage. It's dead.

As he strikes again, the creature disintegrates in a flash. It leaves behind a wisp of light, and as they watch, the wisp seems to be absorbed by the large crystal, whose pulsating seems to quicken.

> MALORY  
> Quick, Skerrig! Check the sarcophagus!

	The Hero's Journey says 10 gp per hit die, but I'm feeling generous, so
	I'll say 50 gp per hit die, or 150 gp.

Indeed, Skerrig finds glinting coins, jewels and bars of metal in the creature's sarcophagus. He begins to scoop them into his backpack.

> SKERRIG  
> Ancestors forgive me!

The dust from the ceiling begins to fall, and Skerrig's greed loses out to his will to live. The heroes leg it back through the shrine with the rats, over the river and back on to the platform. They all pull desperately as the ground rumbles and chunks of debris fall all around them. With all of them pulling on the rope, though, they make it back to the surface and out of the tomb. They cry whoops of delight and relief as they realise they've survived their first adventure!





## Rewards

Combat XP:

3 x zombie = 3 x 30 = 90 xp  
6 x giant rat = 6 x 10 = 60 xp  
1 x wight = 1 x 240 = 240 xp  

Total = 390 xp

Amount per character = 390 / 3 = 130 XP

Non-Combat XP:

The system proposed in The Hero's Journey is a little to meta-gamey to work for solo play. I'll award each character 1 x 500 xp for engaging with/surviving a level 1 dungeon.

Grand total = 630 xp

Gold:

grotesque figurine worth 30 gp from area 2  
150 gp from sarcophagus in area 5
I think their employer (details to follow) will pay them. Let's say 25 gp each.

Total = 255 gp

Magic Items:

warhammer +1 from area 3





## Downtime

With his share of the spoils, Malory buys a silver dagger. There's no price, but silver arrows cost five times as much as regular arrows, so I'll say a silver dagger costs 15 gp. He'll buy two. He's saving the rest for a spellbook.

Skerrig buys himself a shield for 10 gp and some other sundry adventuring gear.

Chania buys 10 silver arrows, a longbow and a healer's kit. She also pays 30gp to have Cure Disease cast on her.

	That's probably too little, but I don't want her to suffer for too long!
