## Interlude

What's Chania's story?

Chania is tall and brawny, with spiky brown hair, long at the back (a mullet!), a leather circlet on her forehead, and pretty features. Under her ring mail armour, she wears greens and browns patched over with thick stitching.

Her mother, Maidel, is a human from the town of Malfen, while her father, Baradas, is an elf from Illioch. Although she grew up in the human town, she spent several years learning the ways of the forest under her father's tutelage.

One night, when they were hunting a great stag, she and her father found themselves in the land of the fey. The master of that place, a powerful sidhe, was about to kill Chania trespassing - no one of human blood should trespass in their lands. Her father made a bargain - his service for Chania's life. Since then, Chania has been searching for a way to communicate, and possibly relieve her father of his bond of servitude.





## Setup

Chania was arrested for the attempted murder of her mother, but was released when she produced an alibi. Now she must find out who tried to kill her mother.





## Scene 1
**Setup**: Chania, Malory and Skerrig question Maidel at her bedside.  
**Altered**: Maidel is being looked after at the local church.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Finding out the circumstances of the attack.

> MAIDEL  
> I know it wasn't you, my daughter. I'm so sorry I doubted you. You could never do such a thing, I know it.

> CHANIA  
> It's OK, mum. They looked like me. I understand. I need to know who it was, though. Is there anything you can tell me about what happened.

	Need to invent some interesting clues: [Block, environment]

> MAIDEL  
> I was walking home from the market, and a group of children...youths, really...were playing a game in the street. I paid them no mind, although I didn't know who they were. Not that odd, I'm sure - I don't know everyone in the city after all. Anyway,...

	[Control, competition]

> MAIDEL  
> ...as I was passing, they invited me to take part in a game of chance. You know how I love children, so I agreed. I watched this boy moving cups around so fast! It was like a dream, I was so mesmerised. And then...

	[Celebrate, riches]

> MAIDEL  
> ...and then he announced that I'd won! I don't know about that really. I wasn't even sure I'd said anything. And that's when I saw you...or, someone that looked like you...and you walked right up to me and stabbed me.

Maidel begins to weep gently. Chania holds her mother's hand.

> CHANIA  
> I'm so sorry, mother. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Do you remember which street it was? Do you remember anything about the youths?

	[Refuse, misfortune]

> MAIDEL  
> Just... just that the boy who performed the trick had two missing fingers on his left hand.

Maidel also tells them where she was.

	[Open, elements]

It was on a street known for its open-air market stalls. Not the most central place in town, but just leading up to it.

> SKERRIG  
> We'll find out who did this, Chania's mother. We'll bring them to justice.





## Scene 2
**Setup**: The heroes search for the gang of youths that might have witnessed the attack  
**Altered**: The heroes search for the young magician that might have witnessed the attack  
**What's fun about this scene**: Investigation and role-playing


	Is the young man in the same alley (25%)? 21. Yes.

The group makes its way to the alley where Chania's mother was attacked. Immediately, they see the young man calling out to passers-by. Chania heads over.

> YOUNG MAN  
> Double your money! It's easy! Think you can do it, sir? Come on!

> CHANIA  
> I'll try it. What do I have to do?

> YOUNG MAN  
> Just follow the ball as I move the cups. The eye has to be quick. Do your best!

He starts moving the cups around. Instead of watching the cups, though, Chania just regards the young man. He continues moving the cups around until he notices that she's not watching them. He seems far less confident now.

> YOUNG MAN  
> You... You're supposed to watch the cups. Keep your eye on them!

He continues with the cups, but Chania pays no attention.

> YOUNG MAN  
> OK, well, you like what you see? Stare as long as you want, but I can't give any refunds, sorry.

	Mark 1 sp.

> CHANIA  
> A woman was attacked here a couple of days ago. You saw it.

	Roll on monster reaction chart. 9. Possibly friendly, then roll again.

> YOUNG MAN  
> Yes, I remember. I already spoke to the guard. Spent a night in the clink until they figured out it wasn't me.

> CHANIA  
> What did you tell them, the guards?

	Rolling monster reaction. 8. Friendly.
	What does the young man know? [Trust, magic]

The young man pulls Chania aside and looks around warily.

> YOUNG MAN  
> I'll tell you what I told them, although I'm not sure you'll believe me. The sun was going down, so it was a little dark. The woman came to my stall. I see her sometimes walking by, and she stops and sometimes gives money to the street urchins. She asked for a round of cups, and as I was doing it, this figure came out of nowhere, and next thing I knew, the woman was screaming.

> CHANIA  
> What do you remember about this figure.

> YOUNG MAN  
> It's hard to say. He - I think it was a he - was tall and wore a cloak and hood. I couldn't see much under his hood, but... But his skin was pale, and veiny. Not like a normal man, though. His veins were glowing faintly. I could tell because of the dim light. Glowing. I know it sounds weird, but that's what he looked like. The next thing I knew, he was gone and the woman was on the ground. I called for the guards while I waited with the woman, and they arrested me. I don't know what happened to her. Do you know if she lived?

> CHANIA  
> She lives. Probably thanks to you. Can you remember anything else?

	[Abuse, friendship]

The young man pauses a moment.

> YOUNG MAN  
> Hmm... It's hard to remember...

Chania flips him another silver.

	[Disrupt, balance]

> YOUNG MAN  
> I don't know. I felt strange when I looked at him. Kind of dizzy, like my eyes were full of tears, but I wasn't crying. And there was a strange... humming sound. Sorry. That's about it.

> CHANIA  
> Did you see the weapon he stabbed her with?

	Did he (50%)? 82. No.

> YOUNG MAN  
> No. It happened so fast.

> CHANIA  
> Was anyone else around?

	Was there (65%)? 53. Yes. Rolling on Character Identity table in the
	Adventure Crafter. [Wanderer, professional].

> YOUNG MAN  
> Yes, now you mention it, there was someone. Looked like a pilgrim.

	[Naive, young]

> CHANIA  
> OK. Thanks for the help. If you think of anything else, look for me at the...

	Tavern name: The Five Hands Inn

> CHANIA  
> ...at the Five Hands. Do you know it?

The young man nods, and the party moves on.

	I've named the young man Naylam.

	I don't like these meandering investigation/social interaction scenes, so
	for the next scene, I'll say that the party follows the clues to the next
	dungeon. I'll generate some details for that trail, as well as the next
	dungeon location.





## Scene 3

	I've generated a new plotline, The Imposter. Maidel was an imposter. She
	was killed and an imposter took her place, using illusions and tricks to
	convince witnesses that she'd been attacked. When the imposter discovers
	that the party has found this out, they skip town, taking the map to
	Havronan's Tomb with them. Chania tracks them through the wilderness, and
	they now stand at the entrance to their hideout.

	Now, I'll use Mythic Magazine #3 to generate the dungeon.

	Type (d3): 2. Ancient.

	Size: Small

	Story: Originally built for evil purposes. Also, [expose, intellect]. We'll
	say the dungeon was originally an evil wizard's underground library.

	Descriptors: [Delightfully natural]. Lots of stonework. The dungeon is
	beneath a forest. Although constructed of stone, the roots from the trees
	above have long since found their way through the ceiling and made
	themselves at home.





## Area 1
**Progress Points**: 0  
**Location**: 9. Random [Mysterious, drab]  
**Encounter**: 1. Expected. I'll say there's a puzzle to prevent casual looters.  
**Objects**: 10. Random [Military, official]

The party tracks the imposter for several days. At one point, Chania loses the tracks, but manages by chance to find them again, and follows them to a clearing on the edge of the sacred forest of Illioch. These lands are known to her father and his people, and Chania is familiar with the many dangers that lie within.

	What object does the group find? Is it a group of fallen soldiers (50%)?
	28. Yes.

Eventually, they find a clearing. It looks like a desperate battle took place here some time ago. Several armoured corpses litter the clearing, and from the looks of the scorch marks on their armour, they fell to powerful magic. The group searches around to find anything useful.

	Do they find any weapons (50%)? 17.
	I'll say 7 (1d8) arrows.

Chania collects a few arrows that look viable.

	What normal equipment do they find? There are 27 x 2 = 54 items on the
	Hero's Journey equipment list. Roll 1d100, and reroll 55 or higher.
	53. Whetstone.

Other than a decent-looking whetstone, which Chania also pockets, there isn't much that the heroes can use. Any food they had would have long spoiled.

	Speaking of food, how much did they consume on the journey? Each hex is
	24 miles, or one day of travel, and they travelled 3 hexes. I think they
	would have known to buy provisions, so I'll say they bought a week's
	worth of rations each. That's 21 gp each for Skerrig and Malory.

	Chania doesn't have enough gold. I'll say she can roll her Forestry skill
	to see if she can get food:
	Day 1: 3. No. Mark one ration.
	Day 2: 3. No. Mark one ration.
	Day 3: 6. No. Mark one ration. She'll have to eat one of Skerrig's rations.

Skerrig cusses at Chania for not telling him to buy more rations before they set off.

> CHANIA  
> I thought these lands would be teeming with game. There's something not right here. Not right at all.

Next, they turn to the entrance to the dungeon.
