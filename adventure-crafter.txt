## Plotline Notes

### The Imposter

Maidel was an imposter. She was killed and an imposter took her place, using illusions and tricks to convince witnesses that she'd been attacked. When the imposter discovers that the party has found this out, they skip town, taking the map to Havronan's Tomb with them. Chania tracks them through the wilderness, and they now stand at the entrance to their hideout.

	Fraud: A Character is a fraud. Whatever it is they are presenting
	themselves as, or whatever story they have told of themselves, is false.
	This result differs from Hidden Agenda, where in Hidden Agenda the
	Character may legitimately have both motives in mind, whereas in Fraud the
	image or story they are presenting is completely fake. For instance, the
	prince claiming he is the rightful ruler of a kingdom is actually a
	shapeshifting doppelgänger assuming the role. [5, 90]

	Character Steps Down (Meta): A Character becomes less important, remove
	them from one slot on the Characters List even if it removes them
	completely from the List. If this would remove a Player Character
	completely from the List, or if when rolling for the Character you get a
	result of “New Character”, then treat this as a result of “Choose The Most
	Logical Character”. If there is no possible Character to choose without
	removing a Player Character completely from the List, then roll again on
	the Meta Plot Points Table. This change can be reflected in the activity
	in this Turning Point or not. [8, 99, 46]

	A Character Is Attacked In A Lethal Way: An assailant is trying to kill a
	Character. [3, 28]

	Escape: This Turning Point involves an escape of some sort. For instance,
	a Character who was captured by brigands in an earlier Turning Point
	manages to slip away from his captors and escape into the forest. [3, 45]

	Theft: This Turning Point involves a theft, whether attempted or
	successful. What is being stolen is an object of some kind, or information,
	or anything that can be taken. This Turning Point involves the actual
	activity and action of the theft or attempted theft. For instance, the
	Character is strolling through a museum when a group of men burst in to
	steal a ritual mask. [2, 73]

### Matricide

While they were away, Maidel, Chania's mother, was attacked. Maidel was severely injured, but managed to survive. It has been blamed on Chania. Something important was taken from Maidel's home. Is it connected to the blue goo?

Ideas:

- City-based dungeon adventure - sewers, under the castle, a warehouse, etc.
- Or a dungeon nearby the city, say an assassin's hideout.
- Don't make it too opaque.

	A Character Is Attacked In A Lethal Way: An assailant is trying to kill
	a Character. [3, 29]

	Framed: A Character is unfairly framed by another Character. For instance,
	a mob boss plants evidence to make it look like a police detective has
	committed a crime. [5, 77]

	Theft: This Turning Point involves a theft, whether attempted or
	successful. What is being stolen is an object of some kind, or information,
	or anything that can be taken. This Turning Point involves the actual
	activity and action of the theft or attempted theft. For instance, the
	Character is strolling through a museum when a group of men burst in to
	steal a ritual mask. [1, 72]

	A Common Thread: It is learned that events that appeared to be unrelated
	have a commonality after all. For instance, a rash of crimes has beset the
	city, from car jackings to break ins. It turns out the culprits all work as
	security guards in the same building. [5, 68]

### The Blue Goo

The heroes were hired to find and explore Havronan's Tomb. Unbeknownst to them, an adventuring party recently entered the tomb and awakened an ancient evil. Little do they know that they are pawns in the machinations of someone who wants to exploit this ancient evil.

	Adventure Crafter Results

	The Secret To The Power: There is a power, and it has a secret source.
	For instance, an evil wizard may derive his abilities from his ancient
	staff, or the warship hurtling through space may be dependent on a simple
	power core inside that will cripple the ship if it is damaged. This secret
	gives Characters an option to stop an otherwise overwhelming or powerful
	problem. [5, 71]

	Sole Survivor: This Turning Point involves some kind of process of
	elimination where there is only one left. This can be a battle, but doesn’t
	have to be. For instance, maybe a sinking ship has a single survivor who
	washes up on shore, or a group of crewmen from a starship playing chess
	with an alien intelligence is down to their last crewmember who is now
	chosen for the alien’s ultimate challenge. [1, 61]

	The Hidden Hand: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it is clear
	that it was caused on purpose by someone of unknown identity. For instance,
	if a Character is ambushed by bandits, the bandit leader may make a
	mysterious reference to their “benefactor” having paid for the attack. Or,
	an engine failure on a ship may be found to have been caused by obvious
	tampering. [5, 80]

	Rural Setting: This Turning Point involves a rural setting, such as out in
	the country or at a farm. [7, 86]

### Havronan's Tomb

The heroes are ambushed by [something gory] outside the great doors of Havronan's Tomb.

	Adventure Crafter Results

	Grisly Tone: Whatever is going on in this Turning Point, the tone of it is
	grisly, something that causes horror or disgust. For instance, if a note is
	discovered with a grisly tone it may be smeared in blood or be accompanied
	by a severed hand. [9, 37]

	Something Exotic: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it involves
	an unusual or exotic element. For instance, if the Turning Point is about
	someone being attacked by an assassin, the assassin may have a very unusual
	identity or mode of attack (maybe he’s disguised as a clown and attacks
	with exploding balloons, or he is a martial artist with fantastic moves).
	[8, 45]

	Physical Barrier To Overcome: A Character faces a physical barrier of some
	sort that must be overcome. It could be a cliff that needs to be climbed,
	a rickety bridge to cross, a door that needs to be knocked down, etc.
	Whatever the barrier is, it will require physical action to get past.
	[3, 69]

	Ambush: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves sudden action
	at an unexpected time. [4, 30]
